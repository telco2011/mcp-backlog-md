# Progress

## What Works

- All the features are implemented.
- The MCP server can be started and loads all the tools.
- Unit tests have been created for all the tools and are passing.
- The tests have been reviewed and improved to cover more cases.
- A comprehensive, contextual logging system using Pino has been integrated.

## What's Left to Build

- The integration test for the MCP server is not working and has been removed. This needs to be revisited.

## Current Status

- The project is in the development and testing phase.

## Known Issues

- The integration test for the MCP server is failing due to a module resolution issue with the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` package.
- A persistent TypeScript error related to a missing `backlogReInit.ts` file appears when editing test files. This does not seem to affect the tests themselves, but it should be investigated.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- No major decisions have been made yet.
