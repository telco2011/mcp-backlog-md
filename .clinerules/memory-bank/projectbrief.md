# Project Brief: mcp-backlog-md

## Core Requirements & Goals

This project is a command-line tool and MCP server for managing a backlog of tasks in a simple, text-based format (Markdown).

The primary goals are:

- Provide a simple, yet powerful, command-line interface for managing tasks.
- Expose the core functionality as an MCP server, allowing other tools to interact with the backlog.
- Keep the data format simple and human-readable (Markdown).
- Support the full lifecycle of a task: from draft to completion and archival.
- Allow for the creation and management of related documentation and decisions.
