## Description

The `README.md` mentions `pino` for structured logging, but the implementation primarily uses `console.info`. This should be standardized to use a configurable logger like `pino` throughout the application.

## Implementation Plan

1. Add `pino` and `pino-pretty` as dependencies.\n2. Create a centralized logger instance.\n3. Replace all `console.info`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` calls with the logger instance.\n4. Use child loggers to add context (e.g., tool name, request ID) to log messages.\n5. Configure the logger to be configurable via environment variables (e.g., log level).

## Implementation Notes

This task was archived because the decision was made not to use a structured logger like pino, making this task obsolete.
