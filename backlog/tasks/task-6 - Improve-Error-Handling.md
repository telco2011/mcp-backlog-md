## Description

The current error handling in `commandExecutor.ts` is good, but it could be more structured. It should distinguish between errors from the `backlog.md` tool itself and system-level errors (e.g., command not found).

## Implementation Plan

1. Create custom error classes for different types of errors (e.g., `CliError`, `SystemError`).\n2. In `commandExecutor.ts`, catch errors and wrap them in the appropriate custom error class.\n3. Update the server's central error handler to handle these custom error types and return more informative error messages to the client.
