## Description

Update the memory bank files to accurately reflect the current state of the project, based on the package.json and file structure. This includes removing incorrect references to pino and pino-pretty.

## Implementation Plan

1. Edit techContext.md to remove pino and pino-pretty and update dependencies; 2. Edit systemPatterns.md to remove mention of Pino; 3. Edit progress.md to remove the statement about the logging system; 4. Edit activeContext.md to reflect the current task of updating documentation.

## Implementation Notes

Updated systemPatterns.md to reflect the use of Zod and change-case.

Updated progress.md to remove the incorrect statement about the logging system.

Updated activeContext.md to reflect the current focus and next steps.

Total time spent: 1 minute and 26 seconds.
